I am a certified Electrical Engineer in Greece and have been occasionally undertaking as a contractor several projects on the design of wireless networks. In 2005, I provided a short training course to 80 employees of the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (OTE S.A.) on the optimal installation of indoor/outdoor wireless networks. In 2006, I was also working as a network designer of a Metro-WiFi network in the city of Igoumenitsa, Greece (15K residents). In the summer of 2009. I signed a contract with the Technical Chamber of Greece to provide educational material for training greek engineers on the installation of wireless networks. More information and links are provided in the project section.
