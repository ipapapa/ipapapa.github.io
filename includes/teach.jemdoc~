= Teaching Abstract

In NC State University, I have worked as a Teaching Assistant in several undergraduate and graduate courses. I have collaborated with the Engineering Online of NC State University in order to implement and evaluate synchronous e-Learning technologies for the distance education students. 

In the graduate level courses, we incorporated both asynchronous (e.g video recordings) and synchronous types of assisting (e.g. virtual meeting rooms). In the undergrad classes, I was working as a lab instructor through video broadcasting to UNC at Asheville, NC.
