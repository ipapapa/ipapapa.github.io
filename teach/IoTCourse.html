<h2>Overview  </h2>
<p>Internet  of Things (IoT) is the interconnection and interaction of people, things,  process and data. As Gartner estimates there will be 26 Billion IoT units by  2020.  This course provides an introduction in concepts,  challenges, and recent developments around the IoT and M2M. The students will  be exposed to the fundamental issues that arise in the operation, design and  management of IoT networks. Such issues include business objectives and  technical design requirements, IoT building blocks (architectures and reference  models), enabling technologies, IoT protocol stacks, analytics, security and  privacy. Students will understand the fundamental issues in the operation,  design and management of IoT networks and enabling technologies, identify tools  that help an administration perform such tasks, obtain business requirements  regarding an IoT system and translate these requirements into technical specs,  and finally design an IoT system.</p>

<h2>Topics Covered</h2>
<ul><li>
  <p>Introduction to IoT</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>IoT components (Things, Data, People and Processes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Architectures of IoT (IoT-A model, three-tier model, service and management in IoT, abstract model)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Security and Privacy in IoT</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Enabling Technologies in IoT (sensing, mobility, virtualization, data visualization, IPv6)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Analytics (across and in verticals)</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Standards and Open source activities in the IoT space (IETF standards, IEEE, ITU, ETSI and ISA bodies, standards in management)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open  source activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open issues and research problems in IoT</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Case studies</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Skillset</h2>
<p>Traditionally,  a network specialist in an IT department of an enterprise was expected to have  skills in the topics of Device configuration, continuous operation, problem  solution, hands-on repair deployment, and reactive management skills. On the other hand, a software developer was employed to develop the software to support, and manage the applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A person with this skillset will probably be  employed by “consumers” of an IoT technology (e.g. the oil industry)</li>
  </ul>
<p>In  the IoT setting, these job roles are shifting towards Business/IT innovation,  architecture (End-to-End) design, network analytics &amp; optimization,  programming API vs CLI, comprehensive policy management, and proactive  management tasks. In this course, we will focus on (a) the administrator of an  IoT system, and (b) the designer/architect of an IoT system. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A  person with the IoT skillset will be employed by “consumers” and “providers” of  the IoT technology (e.g. Cisco, IBM etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience will be students with  interest in computing, distributed systems, programming, machine 2 machine  (M2M) connections, Machine 2 people (M2P) connections, embedded systems,  computer networks. </p>

<h2>Hands on Labs</h2>
<p>A number of sensors, Systems on  Chip (Raspberry PIs, Intel Galileo 2, Qualcomm Snapdragons and NVIDIA Tegra  TK1) and Apple iBeacons will be available to students for prototyping. The  students will select across a variety of projects. There will also be industry  sponsored projects. The goal of the selected project is to develop the ability  to read new protocols; gain experience programming sensors; develop protocol  design skills. </p>
<h2>Guest Speakers and Sponsors</h2>
  <p>All guest speakers are announced during the semester to the registered students in Blackboard.</p>
  <p>If you wish to sponsor an IoT project,  give a talk, or provide feedback please contact me: ipapapan {at} purdue {dot} edu</p>
