Incude Pages 

You'll find a number of pages in the includes folder - to make site-wide changes, open one of the pages, modify the information and then save.  
If for example you need to add more news sections, go to Insert>Component>Include Page and browse to the file you need to include.
You can of course copy and paste the information into the space where the include page is located if you prefer, or delete the include entirely.

Graphics

The template comes with a .png for the company name, buttons, left graphic, welcome image and top separators for you to modify in Fireworks. These can be found in the extra images folder.
There are also blank gifs if you don't use Fireworks
The TTS logo is just there as a placeholder and should be replaced with one of your own.
The font for the company name is Bauhaus Md BT size 30
The font for the welcome gif is Bauhaus Md BT size 22

CSS

The template uses Cascading Style Sheets to determine the text size, colour and hyperlink properties. These can be edited by double clicking on the file style.css.
